1. Implementation of a queue based on a linked list as the underlying data structure
2. A doubly ended queue is used to allow operations on either end, as Queue is a FIFO structure
3. Like the stack, Queue is also an example of an abstract data type - as user can only focus on the queue operations without needing to think about the underlying implementation(linked list vs array)
