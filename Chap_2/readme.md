Code from the chapter on arrays, describing basic operations on array - insert, delete, search.
Also shows use of unordered arrays and ordered arrays.
Last, shows use and efficienct of binary search algorithm for faster search time O(logN) on ordered arrays over regular linear search O(N) on unordered arrays.
